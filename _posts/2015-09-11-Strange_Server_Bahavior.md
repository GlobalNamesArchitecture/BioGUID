The server has been acting strangely all day long, and I'm not sure why. I've had to restart it several times, and it seems OK for a while, but then it grinds to a halt.  I can't help but think that I might have broken something yesterday during my marathon session to port the new code over to the site via the ship's internet, but I don't see any obvious issues, and there are no smoking guns in any of the activity logs. I'll keep an eye on it and see if the problem continues.
