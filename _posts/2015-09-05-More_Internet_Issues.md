Crap! The ship's internet sort of works for email and web pages, but heavier lifting (like transferring Code to the BioGUID server) seems to be blocked.  So.... some of the pages got trasnferred, but a lot of the back-end Code did not. I'm hoping to get this solved within the next few days.  My apologies!
