YIKES!  OK, I just discovered an issue where Identifiers might be linked to records that don't exist in the Object table!  This was a serious oversight on my part in establishing the core database infrastructure.  It's nearly 4am here in Hawaii, so I'll have to deal with this tomorrow. I don't know how extensive the problem is, but the server may be intermittently offline for the next day or two -- depending on how many records are affected.
