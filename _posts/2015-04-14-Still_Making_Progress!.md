Once again, an absence of posts to this news-feed does not reflect an absence of progress. Last week I downloaded a new cut of the GBIF dataset (identifier fields only â€” thanks again to Tim!), and I spent this weekend processing and indexing it. This time I did the processing on a different server so that I wouldn't impact performance on the production server. The bad news is that there are still 11 hours left on a 36-hour FTP transfer of the processed file to this server. Sigh...
