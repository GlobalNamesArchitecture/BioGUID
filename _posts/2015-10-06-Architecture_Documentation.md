Oh, and by the way... while I was waiting for the Tomcat thing to sort itself out, I spent some time creating a new documentation page on the data [Architecture].  It's not finished yet, but it's important to try to get as much documentation online as possible.  Nowhere near as much fun as writing Code, but important nonetheless.  Oh, and another by the way: I updated the content on [GitHub] to include SQL scripts for generating all the objects in the four databases used to run BioGUID. You can access them directly [here].
