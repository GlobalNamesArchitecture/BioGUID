This week, Dima Mozzherin and Alexander Myltsev are visiting me to work on the [Global Names Architecture], and they are very kindly giving me a crash course in using GitHub correctly. I'll report more on our meeting soon (and the relevance of our GNA discussions to BioGUID.org), but over the next week or so, I will be moving more and more content and source code from BioGUID.org to GitHub. Watch this space!
