No, this site is note dead! (Despite what it might seem based on the nearly 5-month hiatus from updating this newsfeed.)  I can't say I've been working on BioGUID.org continuously for the past five months (there was a major [expedition] and some other travelling, some grant proposals and reports to write, some major issues at the Museum, my daughter home for the summer, etc.) However, I can also say that an absence of newsfeed posts does NOT reflect an absence of progress! I will be reporting on the progress over the next few days, but for right now I need to transfer the latest Code to the Production site in time for the [GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Challenge] (Round 2) deadline.
