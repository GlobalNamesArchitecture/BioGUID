By the way, I forgot to mention earlier that I decided to expand the categories of search result matches to three.  I used to split "Exact Matches" from "Close Matches", but "Exact" matches were not really exact.  So, now "Exact" matches literally mean _exact_ matches, where the search term exactly equals the identifier. "Close" matches are now what "Exact" matches used to be: that is, if the search term is found verbatim within the Identifier, but it's not an exact match, then it's considered a "Close" match. Finally, other matches that somehow relate to the search term, but not closely, are displayed in the new category, "Other Matches".  I hope that makes sense...
