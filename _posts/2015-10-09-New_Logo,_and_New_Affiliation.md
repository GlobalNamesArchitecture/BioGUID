If you look really closely, you might have noticed a very subtle change to the BioGUID logo (see the upper banner, and the bottom of the [API Page]; you might need to refresh your browser).  The change involves a slight shift in the hue of the blue and green parts, plus the addition of a third (yellow) link in the chain between "Bio" and "GUID". Also, the background is now white (transparent for the png files). Why did I do this? Well, as I hinted in an earlier post, BioGUID is now formally part of the [Global Names Architecture] (GNA), and to represent this association, the BioGUID logo color scheme has been updated to match that of the GNA logo. Also, BioGUID's GitHub space has been moved to the [GNA GitHub project]. The [old GitHub] site will remain live, but only consists of a note re-directing visitors to the [new BioGUID GitHub site]. Over the next few weeks, I will gradually transfer all the documentation and source code over to the new GitHub repository.
