Making slow but steady progress transferring the Code files.  Unfortunately, last night I tried to transfer some files but the internet on the ship cut out when the power cut out, and I ended up breaking the BioGUID home page!  It's fixed now, but we still have more files to transfer, so there may be some wonkiness on the site over the course of the day.
