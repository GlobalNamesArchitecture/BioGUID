It goes without saying that I am [EXTREMELY GRATEFUL]! I am deeply grateful to the Ebbe Nielsen Challenge jury members, and especially to GBIF for its efforts, including the establishment of this Challenge, to help the world gain access to biodiversity data. Congratulations also to Peter Desmet, Bart Aelterman and Nicolas No√© for their work on [Datafable], which very-much deserves the first-place award!
