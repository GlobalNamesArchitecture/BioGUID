After returning from our expedition to the land of ample bandwidth (and putting out all manner of fires and catching up on some badly needed sleep), I was finally to upload the rest of the Code for BioGUID.org. The good news is that the full functionality of the site is finally working!  The bad news is that there still seems to be a memory leak associated with bulk uploading datasets.  I will continue to research this for the remainder of the weekend.  I also need to update all the documentation, and get all the source code loaded onto GitHub. I hope to have this done within the next couple of days.
