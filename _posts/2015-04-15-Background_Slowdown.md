DAMN! I guess I picked the wrong time to run a bunch of background processes! To everyone visiting this site for the first time: I **promise** that the search results are normally very fast (1-3 seconds)!  But I'm moving around 220GB of data right now (along side the 550GB BioGUID database), so the system is much slower than normal!  I'll try to get it back to the normal stable/fast performance as soon as possible!
