So... I noticed a lot of queries for filenames ending with ‘.jsp’ (obviously robot probes looking for security holes). Out of curiosity, I did a [search on ‘.jsp’], and came up with three objects, one of which had a zillion linked identifiers. At first I thought it was an error, but it's actually correct (all are identifiers associated with the [Black-headed Gull, _Chroicocephalus ridibundus_]). However, at least two of the links were broken. The IUCN identifier had been linked to ‘106003240’ (should be [‘22694420’]), and the OBIS identifier had been linked to ‘834981’ (should be [‘460266’]). I corrected both records, but my concern is: how many other identifiers out there really aren't so peristent? And... should BioGUID.org track historical identifiers (with re-direction to the correct ones)? Food for thought.
