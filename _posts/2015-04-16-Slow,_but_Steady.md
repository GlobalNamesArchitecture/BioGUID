I'm still running batch processes behind the scenes, so I sincerely apologize for the inconsistent performance. Almost all of these resource-intensive processes are related to initializing datasets and generating additional indexes. Once the dust settles, routine content enrichment should be far less resource-intensive, and will have much less of an impact on the overall performance of the system. Until then, thanks for bearing with me!
