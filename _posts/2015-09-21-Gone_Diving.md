After eight consecutive days of deep diving, plus several days of no internet access (not to mention a temporarily broken keyboard on my very expensive laptop...), I'm finally now able to get back on the BioGUID server to finish transferring code for the new data services. Unfortunately, when I logged in to the server, I discovered there has been a pretty serious memory leak issue.  This was not evident on the development server, and it _might_ just go away when I get the rest of the code ported (oh, to be that lucky!). However, I'm bracing myself for several tedious hours of troubleshooting through what feels like the equivalent of a 9600baud modem connection to the internet. *sigh* On a brighter note, I was able to finish up a major NSF proposal due on Tuesday, and just finished uploading it to the NSF website. Of course, I need to do this at 1am local time to avoid competition for the precious few data bits I can send and receive to the internet...
