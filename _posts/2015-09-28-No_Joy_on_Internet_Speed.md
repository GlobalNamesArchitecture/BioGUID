Well... my hopes of having better internet access from the ship have not panned out, so I am still unable to finalize the code on the BioGUID server.  There have been some issues with the server itself, but it seems to be working most of the time. The good news is that I will be back in the land of high-speed internet in two days, so I hope to have everything uploaded by October 1.
