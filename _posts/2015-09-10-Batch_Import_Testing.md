I've just run a test of the Batch Import feature and it seems to be working correctly. Currently, it requires careful [formatting] of the submitted CSV file, but when we return to Hawaii we plan to implement a system similar to the IPT system, where content providers can create a metadata file describing the structure of the batch file, and then generate updates on a web server that can be regularly updated and harvested by BioGUID.org. It had been my intention to have most of this implemented before I got on the NOAA ship, but I let it slide because I figured I could finish it on the ship. Little did I realize how painstaking that process would be! To give you an idea how tedious it has been, each keystroke and mouse click takes about 3 seconds through the ship's internet!
