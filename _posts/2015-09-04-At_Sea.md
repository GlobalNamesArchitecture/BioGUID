Oh, and by the way... I'm on a NOAA ship enroute to the remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (amid a few hurricanes), trying to upload two large video files through a very slow and tenuous satellite internet connection. Obviously, it would have been smart to have transferred the files before getting on the ship; but alas, the days leading up to this cruise were filled with preparations for the cruise!
