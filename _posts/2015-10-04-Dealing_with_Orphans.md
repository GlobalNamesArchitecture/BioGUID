OK, after a brief nap, I've got a routine working now to fix all the orphaned identifiers (i.e., identifier record linked to Object records that don't yet exist in BioGUID.org).  As soon as that's done, I'll alter the database to prevent it from happening again (rookie mistake on my part). Meanwhile, I just discovered a glitch that was causing the "Exact Matches" vs. "Close Matches" to give funky results when searching for identifiers.  It should be fine now.
