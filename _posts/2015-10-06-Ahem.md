Hokay... so I was able to track down the source of the runaway Tomcat situation.  It turned out to be a screen-scraping exercise to harvest identifier cross-links against another website on the same server (yeah, I'm looking at you, [Global Phylogeny of Birds] people.... ahem).  Actually, I have no problem with them doing it; it just messed up my memory leak test; so I'm going for another 24 hours to see if I really did fix the problem. In any case, all that screen-scraping thing really tells me is that I need to finish making BioGUID services much more functional, and much more visible, so people can just come and get the cross-linked identifiers, without having to ping them one at a time at a rate of about 20 per second...
