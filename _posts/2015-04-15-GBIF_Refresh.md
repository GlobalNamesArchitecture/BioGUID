The FTP transfer of the new GBIF download is complete, and I'm running some batch processing in the background. Over the next few days there will be periods of time when the server is much slower than normal (including right now). I hope to have this done within the next couple of days, and I will try to confine the processing to the middle of the day in Hawaii (night-time everywhere else in the world!)
